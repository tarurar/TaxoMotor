SPSD has a built in extension system which allows you a way to de-couple your custom scripts from the main
deployment script. By that, you can update SPSD and the extension independently and also re-use the extension
for multiple different deployments.
                
An extension consists of a 
    - extension folder in the Scripts/Extensions folder which 
		* must have a manifest.xml file
		* a .ps1 file with your custom PowerShell commands (see Example.ps1)
                      
    - extension configuration file in the SPSD/Environments folder
	  or a section in an existing environment file (see Environments/Example.xml)
                    
Please have a look into the other example extensions files to understand how each of it works.
